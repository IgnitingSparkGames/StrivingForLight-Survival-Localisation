# How To Contribute

First of all thanks for considering contributing to the translations for Striving for Light: Survival. Here are the steps to get you started contributing to the translations:

1. Create a github account.
2. If you are logged into your account press the "Fork" button on the top right of the screen here at the translation repository. A "fork" creates a copy of the translation project which then is local to your github account.
3. Navigate to your repositories (press the account icon (top right of screen) -> your repositories. You should now see that the translations project was added to your projects.
4. As you now own the project as well you can either download the files and edit the translation files in an editor of your choice (like excel for example) or you can directly edit the files in the browser via github by just clicking on the files in the project of your github account.
5. If you are finished then you can then either drag and drop the file into the browser to upload it back into the project or if you have modified the translations directly via github website you don't have to upload anything. (More information on this here: https://github.blog/2016-02-18-upload-files-to-your-repositories/) 
6. Once you are finished and happy with the changes you can press the "contribute" button that is visible when you navigate to your translation repository whith your changes. This will create a pull request. We then see all your commits and can merge them into the main project. Other people can also view the request and add comments if we should approve this to be merged into our translations or suggest changes.

## FAQ:
1. It maybe is a helpful information that each time you change a file and when you are done you will do a "commit" which basically is the confirmation that you want to save the changes you have made into your project, there you can also add a commit message like "updated french translation for skill descriptions" so that you and also we know what you have changed.
